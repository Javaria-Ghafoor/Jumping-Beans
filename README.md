# Jumping-Beans
A simulation of the jumping beans https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azb9bDktZVc  

This repository includes different simulation and optimization codes for "the numerical solution for time taken to topple down an inclined surface" of the theoretical equations Team Pakistan derived for the 14th Problem in International Physicists' Tournament 2020.  

Problem Statement:  
A simple toy called a “jumping bean” can be constructed by putting a metal ball inside of a pill capsule. Placed on an inclined surface at a certain inclination, the jumping bean will tumble down in a rather surprising way, seemingly standing up-right, flipping end to end, instead of rolling. Investigate its motion. Find the dimensions of the fastest and slowest beans for a given inclination.  

What the python scripts contain:  
- jumping_beans.py "physical simulation"  
- value_calculation.py "numerical calculation of times for different alphas"  
- optimization.py "in general opitimization code to compute dimensions on extremum times"  
- length.py "time for length variations keeping everything else constant"  
- radius.py "time for radius variations keeping everything else constant"  
- density_capsule.py "time for capsule density variations keeping everything else constant"  
- denisty_ball.py "time for ball density variations keeping everything else constant"  

Feel free to go through it and constructively critique the solution! :D
